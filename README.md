# Learning to Reconstruct 3D Manhattan Wireframes From a Single Image

This branch contains a newer version of ShapeUnity that has a vanishing points branch. However, we only use this branch to predict vanishing points because our results are built upon a checkpoint from the master branch.

This branch requires a different version of the dataset with `vpts` as labels, which can be
downloaded from [this Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S0Pn8FoPXmP_Badd-d71h5DO7BZE91sq/view?usp=sharing).
